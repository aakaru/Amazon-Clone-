# Amazon-like Static Site

This project is a static site designed to resemble an Amazon web page, created using HTML and CSS.

## Description

The site aims to replicate the basic structure and layout of Amazon's homepage, offering a static representation of its navigation bar, hero section, and various product boxes. It does not feature actual functionalities like purchasing or dynamic content retrieval.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Mimics Amazon's navigation bar with different sections like 'Deliver to,' search functionality, user account, orders, and cart.
- **Hero Section**: A banner with a message and a link redirecting users to Amazon India.
- **Shopping Section**: Displaying different product boxes with images and descriptions.
- **Footer**: Mimics Amazon's footer with various sections like 'Get to Know Us,' 'Make Money With Us,' 'Amazon Payment Products,' and 'Let Us Help You.'

## Instructions

1. **Viewing the Site**: To view the site, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Styling**: The styles are defined in the `amazonstyle.css` file, located in the same directory as the HTML file. Modify this CSS file to change the styling of the site.
3. **Images**: The images used in the project are referenced in the CSS file. Make sure the image URLs are correctly linked or replace them with your desired images.
4. **External Dependencies**: The site uses Font Awesome CDN for icons. Ensure an internet connection for proper rendering.
